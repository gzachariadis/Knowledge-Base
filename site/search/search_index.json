This is the default, when it comes to passkeys as their purpose is to associate a specific device, through the use of a private-key to a specific account.</p> <p>When you use a device-bound passkey, your device stores a unique key that is only usable on that device. This means that even if someone tries to hack into your account, they would need physical access to your specific device to gain entry.</p> <p>It's worth noting that while the private-key is device-bound, if that two devices can come into proximity and prove presence, for example with NFC or Bluetooth, the private-key can still be accessed remotely. This creates a form of \u201csyncing\u201d between devices, because the private-key never leaves the actual hardware device, but the authenticator module, can \"roam\" between devices. </p> <p>Device-bound passkeys, on multiple devices can be time-consuming the first-time around; requiring you to go through each of the services that support it, and sit through the process of associating it with your account. Think of it, like changing your password to all your accounts, all at once.</p> <p>Usage Tips</p> <ul> <li> <p>Backup, Backup, Backup \u2014 Device bound passkeys, are susceptible to hardware loss or failure, both of those, can result in being temporarily or permanently locked out of accounts.

On top of that, it's an unofficial form of backup, making you less likely to be locked out of your accounts.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"digital-accounts/authentication/passwordless-authentication/authentication-methods/passkeys/#cloud-syncing","title":"Cloud Syncing","text":"<p>Passkeys, by default, are unique to each service, and device. Having said that, they can be synced and backed up across devices, preferably through a Password Manager or by an end-to-end encrypted Cloud Service Provider. </p> <p>The syncing of private-keys, typically, happens through cloud services like iCloud Keychain (for Apple devices) or Google Passwords (for Android/Chrome devices). These services securely sync private-keys across your devices, allowing you to login to your accounts using the same private-key on multiple devices.</p> <p>That's worth explaining a bit more, when you set up a passkey on a device, like your phone, the private-key is usually stored on device. In this case, it's stored on the cloud. Your cloud account becomes this private vault, where your private-keys are stored and securely synced, or better put, accessed from your devices ensuring you can authenticate/prove account-ownership on any device with access to your cloud account. Careful of that last part, that doesn't mean only your devices.</p> <p>Usage Tips</p> <ul> <li> <p>Encryption \u2014 Make sure the private-key is always remains encrypted during syncing, which means it cannot be read or intercepted by anyone; even the service providers (like Apple or Google). Only your devices should be able to decrypt your private-key.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stewardship \u2014 Remember, private-keys are as secure, as the place you store them; in this case, the service provider servers. This means, that, you take responsibility and assign stewardship, as well as, security upon the service provider, to prevent your private-keys against unauthorized access, theft, hacking or loss.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ecosystem Bound \u2014 Stewardship has to be with someone, if you use Apple's iCloud for syncing passkeys, you won\u2019t be able to use it on an Android device, you are eco-system bound to use Apple devices. Of course, you can by-pass this problem, by assigning stewardship to a third-party like a Password Manager, but at the end of the way, the stewardship has to be relied-upon someone.</p> </li> <li> <p>Vulnerability \u2014 While syncing your private-key across devices offers convenience, giving you the freedom to access your accounts from any device, it also exposes all your devices to risk, if one is compromised, all devices using that synchronized private-key could be at risk, possibly resulting in your being locked out of your accounts.</p> </li> <li> <p>Shareability \u2014 You share one private-key between devices, making you susceptible to being locked out. This means that, if anything, you reduced security compared to device-bound private-keys, and ended up switching your threat-factors from hardware failure or loss to software-related like hacking, wipe of device or being locked out of your cloud account.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>Device-bound passkeys are inherently secure, provided they\u2019re properly managed. However, this security comes with its own set of challenges\u2014most notably, the high cost of hardware keys and shouldering the responsibility of stewardship over your data.</p> <p>On the other hand, cloud-based passkeys shift the burden of management away from you. By entrusting a cloud service provider to store and protect your private-keys, you gain the convenience of automated maintenance and remote access. However, this trade-off comes with a compromise in privacy and security, as you must trust your provider to safeguard your keys from hackers and ensure you\u2019re never locked out of your own data.</p> <p>Ultimately, the choice between device-bound and cloud-based passkeys depends on your priorities \u2014 whether you value maximum security and control at the cost of some manual-work and potentially associated costs or prefer the convenience of cloud management at the cost of some privacy.

Hardware Keys.

Pretty great right?!</p> <p>Hmmm\u2026Personally, I would avoid; Somehow having those stored in the same place doesn't sit right with me.</p> <p>For one, you increase your vulnerability, having one app for both, allows for an attacker to have one vector point to attack and if successfully compromised will allow an attacker to have complete access to both aspects of your security.</p> <p>Secondly, what happens if you lose access to this one place?

It\u2019s inconvenient at times, but that\u2019s security for you.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use a Password on your TOTP app, not biometrics. Biometrics are generally less secure than a passphrase.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don\u2019t use the same password you use on your password manager, or to unlock your phone or whatever for your TOTP vault. Choose a unique, hard-to-guess long passphrase preferably.</p> </li> <li> <p>Do not store your backups on the cloud.</p> </li> <li> <p>Store at least one backup of your seeds and emergency codes off-site or somewhere you can have access in case of emergency, so in case you're travelling and get your devices stolen, you can still get in. Encrypted hard-drives or Printed QR codes aka \u201cseeds\u201d on a home safe is a good option.</p> </li> <li> <p>Active development and a reputable source are vital. Be cautious which application you choose, there\u2019s bad actors, there\u2019s unmaintained projects, be cautious when selecting your two-factor authentication app. You are as secure as where your seeds are stored and who can access them.</p> </li> <li> <p>Be cautious with cloud syncing, if you use multiple devices with sync turned on and delete something from one device, it will replicate this decision across multiple devices. That\u2019s what sync fundamentally is.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>While Authentication Apps are better than SMS because they are encrypted and don\u2019t rely on your phone number, they can still be vulnerable if someone gets access to your phone or app through malware or other hacking techniques, or just general mismanagement.</p> <p>To be fair to Authenticator apps, there\u2019s no option out there that alleviates the burdens completely from your shoulder. At the end of the day, managing your TOTP Keys is mandatory, requires manual work and it\u2019s your responsibility, and in no fault of the protocol itself; So if you want to go this route, choose an application based on your use-case and backup your seeds, preferable in more than one place.</p>"},{"location":"digital-accounts/authentication/two-factor-authentication/methods/push-notifications/","title":"Push Notifications &amp; Service Prompts","text":"<p>Pros</p> <ul> <li>No Need for Separate Device</li> <li>Pretty Convenient</li> <li>More Secure than SMS Authentication</li> <li>Can be combined with Biometrics</li> </ul> <p>Cons</p> <ul> <li>Phishing still an issue </li> <li>MFA Fatigue, people would just press yes instinctively.</li> <li>Depends on Human Awareness - their ability to be present and understand the prompt.</li> </ul> <p>Susceptible to MFA Fatigue attacks.</p> <p>MFA Attacks are where you either flood the user with notifications to verify a connection or take advantage of the routine by which most users instantly verify a request like that, because they are used to doing it over and over and over again.
