# Email

Let’s talk about Email…

Some general tips, although Gmail allows for use of a Hardware Key for securing your Google account, as far as I am aware, the only option for you to use a security key on mobile, is to download the Google Smart Lock application.

Vulnerabilities

- Cookie Hijacking

Weak Security

- Poor Passwords
- Insecure Providers
- Non-properly configured Two-Factor Authentication

In case you use email, you have to consider how secure your email provider and your account is. Try to secure your email as hard as you can, use a hardware key or properly configured 2FA. Choose a hard password etc. because you are as secure as your account is.
