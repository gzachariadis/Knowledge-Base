# HTML

## Overview

First things first, HTML is not a programming language. HTML is responsible for the structure of a webpage, it stands for HyperText Markup Language and while highly versatile since HTML5 was released, it's still fairly squared around setting the building blocks for a webpage. It's usually one part of a trio, HTML, CSS and Javascript, which are in turn responsible for styling and functionality.

### Elements

Most elements in HTML have an opening and closing tag, indicating the start and end of an element. Most tags/elements are called “container elements” because they hold items within their opening and closing tag.

There are also tags, that are what’s called as “standalone tags”, these usually don’t hold content but are static, sometimes without a closing tag like the doctype or link.

### Tag Categories

In HTML there are 3 types of tags

- Meta
- Layout
- Content

### Meta

Each one is responsible for a different type of data/content and it contains specific tags that help it with achieving that goal.

Meta Tags are responsible for “behind the scenes” actions

##### DOCTYPE 

informs the browser what document type to expect

##### HTML tag 

The container for all other HTML elements except DOCTYPE.

###### Language tag 

declares the language of the webpage

##### Head 

Similar to “Metadata”

###### Title - Webpage Title
###### Style - CSS Stylesheets

#### Layout

Responsible for organizing your layouts

##### Header (head)
 
- Responsible for navigation

##### Main (main)

- Responsible for main content of the page
	
##### Section (section)

- Responsible for sectioning content
- Related by separated, not standalone, but parts of a “content”

##### Division (div)

Div is short for "division" is a generic container for associating similar content. Mainly used to divide specific pieces of content from the other elements around them and group them with each other.

Similar to grouping elements in other software like Powerpoint, `div`, allows for similar sets of content to form a bond together on a web page. 

##### Article (article)
	
##### Footer (footer)

	-  responsible for social media links, copyrights etc.

#### Content

- responsible for specific content

##### Headings (h1...h6)

Responsible for setting the structure of the page, they provide an outline to your document.

Not to be used for styling purposes, in a sense, you want to have just one h1 heading per page.

##### Anchors (a)

###### External

- URL

###### Internal

- ID of element

##### Span

- Specific Selector
- No specific meaning
- No specific style

### Guidelines

- Your main homepage should be index.html, browsers will look for this exact page every time your website is loaded.
