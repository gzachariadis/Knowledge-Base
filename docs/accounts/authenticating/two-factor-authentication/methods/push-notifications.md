# Push Notifications & Service Prompts

Pros

- No Need for Separate Device
- Pretty Convenient
- More Secure than SMS Authentication
- Can be combined with Biometrics

Cons

- Phishing still an issue 
- MFA Fatigue, people would just press yes instinctively.
- Depends on Human Awareness - their ability to be present and understand the prompt.

Susceptible to MFA Fatigue attacks.

MFA Attacks are where you either flood the user with notifications to verify a connection or take advantage of the routine by which most users instantly verify a request like that, because they are used to doing it over and over and over again. Taking advantage of this, especially when you are busy  and not instantly realizing the danger.

Another form of MFA Fatigue attack is for someone to impersonate IT and call you to convince you to press accept, because there’s a problem and that’s why you are flooded with requests. Coercing you to press accept and allow the attacker access to your account.

These attacks are dangerous, require no hacking skills or expensive tools and can prove successful in many cases.
