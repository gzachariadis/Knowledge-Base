# Welcome

&nbsp;

<ins>This is a series of *guides* and *articles* focused on personal **privacy**, **security** and online **anonymity** made publicly available.</ins>

## About Me

&nbsp;

<ins>Intrigued by technology and personal security, especially as the digital world continued to evolve at a rapid pace; I found myself becoming more concerned about the privacy of my personal information.</ins>

<ins>Over time, we all inadvertently have data collected about us, our activity gets tracked, intimate details about us are gathered by social media platforms, and everything, ends-up in detailed profiles of who we are, sold to third-party brokers and advertisers.</ins>

<ins>I'm just trying to fight back **a little**...</ins>

<br>

## Purpose

&nbsp;

<ins>Pursuing research over these topics, a meticulously curated variety of resources, from technical explanations about encryption to practical advice on minimizing one's digital footprint, started to fall in my lap; as I tried to make sense of it, over time, these documents were **brought to life**. Through the passage of time and many revisions later, *this collection became a blend of academic research, expert interviews, and hands-on tutorials*, each piece carefully curated and edited for its relevance and credibility.</ins>

<ins>Follow me on this journey, as we explore topics such as VPNs, private mobile devices, secure messaging apps, multi-factor authentication, as well as, how these tools could safeguard users against surveillance, data breaches, and identity theft.</ins>

<q>Hope you enjoy your stay...</q>
