# Passwordless Authentication

<br><span>#Definition</span>

> Passwordless authentication is the method of verifying a user's identity without the need for traditional passwords. Instead of relying on a password, passwordless authentication uses alternative methods such as biometric data (fingerprints or facial recognition), one-time codes sent via email or SMS, or passkeys to identify and verify account ownership[^1].

Formatting can also be applied to blocks by putting the opening and closing
tags on separate lines and adding new lines between the tags and the content.
