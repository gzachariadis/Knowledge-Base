# Passwordless Authentication

<br><span>#Definition</span>

> Passwordless authentication is the method of verifying a user's identity without the need for traditional passwords. Instead of relying on a password, passwordless authentication uses alternative methods such as biometric data (fingerprints or facial recognition), one-time codes sent via email or SMS, or passkeys to identify and verify account ownership.

This approach enhances security by reducing the risk of password-related attacks, such as phishing or brute-force attempts, while offering a more convenient and user-friendly experience for individuals.
