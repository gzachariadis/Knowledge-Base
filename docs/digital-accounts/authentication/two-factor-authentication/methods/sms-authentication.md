# SMS Authentication

SMS authentication is a security method that verifies your identity by sending a one-time code to your phone via text message. 

Every time you attempt to login to your account, the service sends this unique, time-sensitive code (often called a "one-time password" or OTP) to your account-associated mobile phone number.  You enter that code into the website or app where you're logging in and it checks if it’s valid. 

Theoretically, this proves you are the owner of the account and in possession of the phone number associated with it.

It's an effective way to prevent unauthorized access and keep your accounts more secure, compared to the standard password authentication. 

However, while it is better than nothing, as far as 2FA standards go, it’s the least secure, and most susceptible to all sorts-of attacks; targeted or not. 

Definitely, one of the weakest options out there, because it simply has the highest attack surface. 

In case you still want to go with this method, or you have to, because some services still require it and there’s no way around it. 

Here’s some tips…

- Depending on where you are from, some cell providers will allow for a physical visit to a store with a photo ID providing it’s you, before switching your phone number. Preventing SIM-swap attacks. It’s not foolproof, but communicating with your provider and letting them put notices on your account can prevent at least some attempts at this attack.

- Makes switching phone numbers really difficult, you have to go back and go through all your accounts and switch to your new phone number, so having a separate phone number where you only use it for authentication can be an option. Look for online private phone numbers, where you might login and see your text message inbox through a virtual phone number or buy a separate phone number which none knows about except the services you use.

- Simply put? Privacy. You might not want any services you have an account with being able to identify you. Your phone number is tied to many accounts and most of all, probably your most important ones, so why give it freely?

- Applications have requirements, when you install them, you allow them to access certain information, if one is compromised and an attacker can read your text messages, you guessed it, you screwed. The least expensive option would probably be switching your phone number to a dumb phone, but I am guessing you don’t want to do that or have two devices, a dumb phone and a smartphone, so yeah, maybe take care of what you install on your phone.

My suggestion? Avoid SMS Authentication whenever possible, it should be your last option.
