Cross-device tracking refers to the practice of monitoring and linking a user’s activities across multiple devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and computers. By tracking interactions and behaviors on different devices, companies can build a more comprehensive profile of a user’s preferences, habits, and online behavior. This often involves using unique identifiers, such as cookies or device IDs, to track users as they switch between devices, making it possible to target them with personalized ads or gather data for analytics. While useful for businesses, cross-device tracking raises privacy concerns as it can lead to increased surveillance of individuals across their devices.
