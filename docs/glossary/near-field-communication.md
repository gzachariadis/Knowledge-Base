### Key Features

- <span>Short Range</span> — Devices are required to be very close to each other, typically within a few centimeters, to communicate. This makes it more secure than longer-range wireless technologies like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
  
- <span>No Pairing Required</span> — Doesn’t require a pairing process before data transfer. Devices can communicate almost immediately upon contact.

- <span>Two-Way Communication</span> — Supports both read and write modes, which means devices can both send and receive information.

### Common Uses

- <span>Contactless Payments</span> — Widely used in mobile payment systems such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, and contactless credit/debit cards.

- <span>Access Control</span> — Provides secure access to buildings or devices (e.g., unlocking doors by tapping a card or phone).

- <span>File Sharing</span> — Quick data exchange, such as transferring photos, contacts, or apps between smartphones.
