# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

<b>Two-factor authentication (2FA)</b> is a security process that requires two separate forms of verification before granting access to an account. 

Most users will have bounced upon this, through a Google Verification SMS (Short Message Service), giving you a 6-8 digit password, which verifies you are the owner of the account you're trying to login into. That’s all two-factor authentication (2FA) does; combines two factors, something you know (your password) with something you have, like access to the phone number associated with the account.

Before we move on to going through and discussing some of the ways to perform Two-Factor Authentication, let’s expand a little bit more on what is the purpose of it. The main purpose is security, to validate you are the owner of the account and prevent unauthorized access, but that’s not the only purpose for many providers, another purpose is KYC (Know Your Customer) aka identifying you. In the case of your bank, of course they know a lot about you, before they even ask for your phone number or another form of two-factor authentication, they don’t need to identify you, they only desire to verify it’s you accessing your funds. That’s not the case with other services, not that this is done in an evil way, most companies have other ways to identify their customers, and other personal information to base your potential identity around, but information like phone numbers can be tied closely to your identity, so be careful how you setup two-factor authentication and what data are you willing to give for this increased secure benefit.
